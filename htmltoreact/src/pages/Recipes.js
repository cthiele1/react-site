              <p>
                Even though the name may indicate otherwise, the German
                Chocolate Cake actually has Southern roots dating back to the
                1950s. The classic cake is defined by its decadent Coconut-Pecan
                Frosting. Just make sure to let the cake layers cool completely
                before lathering on the frosting.

              <p>
                While certainly not the only way to enjoy green tomatoes, this
                is simply the most delectable and Southern way to do it. The
                best fried green tomatoes are crispy, lightly coated slices of
                tangy green tomatoes, fried in vegetable oil or bacon grease.
                Some buttermilk and a 50-50 blend of cornmeal and flour is all
                you need.

              <p>
                In our opinion, the only way to make classic cornbread is in a
                cast-iron skillet. Plus, we skip the sugar and opt for bacon
                drippings instead. Once you have a skillet, all you need is a
                handful of ingredients and 10 minutes to get your cornbread
                cooking.

              <p>
                We love in-season tomatoes so much that we'll bake them into
                pies. With its mayonnaise and shredded cheese, old-fashioned
                tomato pie has a decidedly retro appeal. But unlike retro dishes
                such as congealed salad, we'll chow this down any day.

                Pimiento cheese is one of those recipes that proves a recipe
                doesn't have to be complicated to be a crowd-pleaser. It comes
                together in just 15 minutes with no cooking required, just a
                little bit of grating. Yes, grating your own cheese is vital for
                this recipe, don't dare buy the pre-shredded kind.
