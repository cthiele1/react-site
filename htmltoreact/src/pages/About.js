          <h1>History</h1>
          <p>
            By the 19th century, Southern cooking had begun to take shape, with
            dishes like fried chicken, collard greens, and cornbread emerging as
            staples. Enslaved cooks played a vital role, using their creativity
            to transform limited ingredients into flavorful meals, often using
            spices and cooking techniques from their African heritage. The Civil
            War and the Reconstruction era further influenced Southern cooking
            as communities sought hearty, affordable meals. Recipes for biscuits
            and gravy, gumbo, and jambalaya showcased the resourcefulness of
            Southern families, combining various influences into one pot.
