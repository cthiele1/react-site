            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>
              By the 19th century, Southern cooking had begun to take shape,
              with dishes like fried chicken, collard greens, and cornbread
              emerging as staples. Enslaved cooks played a vital role, using
              their creativity to transform limited ingredients into flavorful
              meals, often using spices and cooking techniques from their
              African heritage. The Civil War and the Reconstruction era further
              influenced Southern cooking as communities sought hearty,
              affordable meals. Recipes for biscuits and gravy, gumbo, and
              jambalaya showcased the resourcefulness of Southern families,
              combining various influences into one pot.
